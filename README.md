# Prospecting Hawaiian Temperature with sqlalchemy

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to show my potential investor, W.Avy, that Oahu will be a suitable location for my surf/ice cream shop. I look at climate data taken from around Oahu over the course of several years, and then use sqlalchemy in Python to filter for data from the months of June and December. The analysis shows that Oahu has a stable climate that tends to the warm side, perfect for my shop.

## Results

### June

### December

Three key differences between June and December weather in Oahu:
- June is more stable than December
- December is slightly cooler than June
- The difference in minimum temperatures is greater than that of the maximum ones

## Summary
 
I'm confident that this data will convice W.Avy to invest in my shop. It shows that the temperature in Oahu is stable throughout the year, with only a minor cooldown from June to December. Odds are that the weather will not have much of an impact on sales, other than making ice cream a bit more in-demand during the summer months.
